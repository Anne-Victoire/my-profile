				<h1>Hello, I'm Anne-Victoire, welcome to my page ! </h1>
				<img src="images/try.jpg" class="img-circle" width="100px" alt="Anne-Victoire de Lantivy">
				<p>
					I'm a 21 years-old student at IESEG School of Management, currently studying <b>Digital Marketing</b> in Master 2 💻. I really like what I study, but one day I would like to <b> launch my own start-up </b> ✨. I just got my driving licence 🚘🚘 and my next goal is to find a <b> 6 months internship starting in January 2023!</b> <br> </br> I am French and have lived in Paris since I was born, but I would like to work in a European country.

				<h2>Professional experiences</h2>
				<p>
					Since the beginning of my studies, I have completed <b>3 internships</b>.<br> </br> Commercial employee at Casino Supermarkets 🏪 Business Devloper at Les Apprêtés 👗 Marketing and Communication Manager at Mini Pelle Rhinoceros 🦏 <br> </br>  My favourite internship was at <b>Les Apprêtés</b> but the one that taught me the most was at <b>Mini Pelle Rhinoceros</b>, because I deepened my skills in Digital Marketing and confirmed that I liked it.

				<h2>Volunteering</h2>
				<img src="images/protec.jpg.jpg" class="img-rectangle" width="500px" alt="Protection Civile">  <br> 🚒🚒🚒</br>
				<p>
					I was a volunteer first aider for 3 years at the <b>Protection Civile de Paris</b>. I had 3 main missions: to <b>help</b> the most destitute people by going on marauding trips and collecting clothes and food, to <b>rescue</b> the population during shifts with the SAMU and the fire brigade and finally to <b>train</b> the French population in first aid techniques.

				<h2>Criminology</h2>
				<p>
					I have a passion for anything related to criminology and investigations. I can spend hours watching <b> true crime documentaries </b>, following cold cases or lisning to podcasts related to the topic. 
					If I could find one day a job related to this, it would be amazing but I know it's not really linked to Digital Marketing. <br> </br> One of my favourite Netflix documentary series is <b> The Kepeers </b>  but I could name hundreds more !  <br> </br>

				<h2>What about 2022 ?</h2>
				<p>
					In January, I left for an academic exchange in Mexico, in <b>Guadalajara</b> for 6 months. It was the  <b> best life experience </b> I ever had ! Otherwise, I am currently writing my master thesis on <b> infinite scroll and consumer behaviour. </b>
